                <p>The tiger is the largest wild cat in the world. It is recognized by its appearance of dark vertical stripes on its red-orange fur. The markings on the tiger are distinct to each tiger as no two tigers have the same markings. </p>
                <p>Tigers mainly live in temperate, tropical, or evergreen forests, mangrove swamps, and grasslands. The availability of prey determines their range. Tigers live far apart from each other, marking their area with urine and scratches on the trees around them. </p>
                <p>Their diet mainly consists of meat and when they hunt their prey, they consume a lot of the meat but usually eat around 12 pounds each meal. They hunt alone and wait until dark to hunt. When they hunt larger prey, they can consume a lot of the meat but sometimes it takes days for a tiger to finish eating the prey. If the tiger becomes full, it will cover the carcass with leaves and dirt and will come back later to feed some more. </p>
                <p>Tigers can live for about 11 years in the wild and can live in captivity for about 20 to 25 years. </p>
